Field work
----------

Three field trips were conducted by two volunteers in three different beaches along the 2018 summer season. With the QGIS project uploaded to their personal smartphones, the data could be easily recorded using the predefined item list, avoiding typing errors that could impact the data analysis process. Pictures were taken for non expected items or items fitting in more than one category for further analysis. ![p](/home/jessica/Documentos/litter/new_images/fig2_qfield.png) By uploading QField data to a computer, basic graphical and spatial products could be assessed in less than 05 minutes after the end of each field work.
